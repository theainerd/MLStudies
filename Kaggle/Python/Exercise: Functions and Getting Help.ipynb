A lot of arbitrary or at least subjective decisions go into designing a programming language, and it's not always possible to deduce from first principles how Python will handle a particular situation.)\n\nBut in this case, the `min` function gamely accepts our string inputs and seems to work as desired! Or, at least on the example in the docstring. However, there's a subtle problem afoot. Try experimenting with the function to see if you can find a set of inputs where it fails.
