# Type of Plots and when to use

## Univariate Plotting

* Bar Plot - Good for nominal and small ordinal categorical data.
* Line Chart - Good for ordinal categorical and interval data.
* Area Chart - Good for ordinal categorical and interval data.
* Histogram - Good for interval data.

## Bivariate Plotting

* Scatter Plot - Good for interval and some nominal categorical data.
* Hex Plot - Good for interval and some nominal categorical data.
* Stacked Bar Chart - Good for nominal and ordinal categorical data.
* Bivariate Line Chart - Good for ordinal categorical and interval data.

## Extras
Faceting is the act of breaking data variables up across multiple subplots, and combining those subplots into a single figure. So instead of one bar chart, we might have, say, four, arranged together in a grid.

* Facet Grid - Good for data with at least two categorical variables.
* Pair Plot - Good for exploring most kinds of data.

## Multivariate Plotting

The most obvious way to plot lots of variables is to augement the visualizations we've been using thus far with even more visual variables. A visual variable is any visual dimension or marker that we can use to perceptually distinguish two data elements from one another. Examples include size, color, shape, and one, two, and even three dimensional position.
